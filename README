# Alternatives

0. single process -> herein
   same host (obviously) with thread-based concurrency (easy debugging)
1. multiple process -> using D-Bus within Tunitas Honsinger
   same host using the session-level D-Bus for inter-process communication.
2. multiple hosts -> using HTTPS microhttpd++ within Tunitas Nuff
   multiple hosts, with wireline packets, with full-dress encryption
3.  multiple hosts -> using HTTPS Apache HTTPd within Tunitas Woodruff
   multiple hosts, with wireline packets, with full-dress encryption
