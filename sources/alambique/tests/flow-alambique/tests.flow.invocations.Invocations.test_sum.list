# Some numbers for the summation
#
# (recall) the format is newline-separated records of natural (non-negative) numbers.
# no unnatural or imaginary numbers; or (less flippantly) no really big numbers either.
#
# comments (obviously) start with a '#' and run to the end of the line
# blank lines are ignored
# leading and trailing spaces are ignored
